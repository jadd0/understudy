# product-kit with-gate-lock.sh v1 — from umbo 0f95e4fa
#
# The cross-worktree gate lock, in one place.
#
#   bash scripts/with-gate-lock.sh <command...>   take the lock, run the command, release it
#   source scripts/with-gate-lock.sh              define gate_lock_acquire (scripts/gate.sh does this)
#
# One gate at a time across every worktree: two concurrent suites sharing a machine, a database
# or a port collide, and a timing run that overlaps another suite measures the collision instead
# of the code. A check-then-run wait in the caller races; this lock does not. mkdir is atomic.
#
# The lock lives in the git common dir, which every worktree of the repo shares, not under
# $TMPDIR: a sandboxed agent shell can carry its own TMPDIR and so its own lock. Liveness is read
# with `ps -p`, not `kill -0`, which fails with EPERM from a sandbox that may not signal outside
# processes and would call a live owner dead. A stale lock is taken over by an atomic rename, so
# of two waiters that both see it stale only one removes it; the other's rename fails and it waits.
#
# Not re-entrant, on purpose: `gate.sh` takes this lock itself, so wrapping the gate in this
# script would leave the gate unlocked the moment its wrapper died (a timeout or a kill reaches
# only the wrapper's pid). Waiting would deadlock on its own parent. So an acquire that finds the
# lock held by one of its own ancestors refuses with exit 2. Run the gate directly; the wrapper
# is for everything else (a targeted test run that needs the shared resources).
# GATE_LOCK_DIR overrides the lock path, for tests of this file only.

# True when $1 is this process or one of its ancestors.
